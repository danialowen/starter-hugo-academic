I am currently in my final year of my integrated MSc/PhD in Data Analytics and Society at the Geographic Data Science Lab at the University of Liverpool. My research interests are utilizing open-sourced sensor data to better understand and explore human dynamics and the functionality of cities. I primarily work in Python, however, I also use R and QGIS.  

During my studies, I have worked on several research projects (*see Projects page*) and undertaken multiple roles (*see Experience or download my resumé*).
